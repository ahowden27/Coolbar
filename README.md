# Coolbar
Sleek GUI toolbar with visual display of resource utilization as well as an extended clipboard for when you need to store multiple pieces of text. Saves to a file in case of a crash. Additionally, copying a zoom invitation will extract only the meeting id and password to the specified clipboard.

To copy a value, use ctrl+shift+(number 1-0). Action occurs only when all three keys are released.
To paste a value, use ctrl+alt+(number 1-0).
To clear a clipboard value, click on the respective button in the GUI.

Built for windows, so results may vary on mac. Also may need to change the resolution in gui.py

Developed mid 2024.
